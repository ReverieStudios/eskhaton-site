	<h3>Food</h3>
	
	<p>Your registration fee includes several meals during the weekend. There will be brunches on Saturday and Sunday, dinners on Friday and Saturday, and snacks provided after dinner hours as well as tea and coffee. Alcohol may be purchased from two on-site bars during the event.</p>
	
	<p>The first provided meal will be the Friday night dinner at the Squantum Association. Note that this is after the first mandatory workshops begin on April 5th, and so attendees should plan to eat before the workshops on their own. There are a number of restaurants around the Hilton Providence, and there will be ample time to eat and arrive at site for workshops.</p>

	<p>Meal selections will include vegetarian, Gluten-Free and vegan options (specific dietary requests can also be noted as part of the participant application). </p>
