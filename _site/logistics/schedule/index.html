	<h2>Schedule</h2>

<section id = "date">
	<h3>Dates</h3>
	
	<p>April 5th through the 7th, 2019. Event starts at 11:00 AM on April 5th at the Hilton Providence.</p>
	
	<p>The event schedule is currently under active development. More details will be posted here as Eskhaton draws near.</p>
</section>

<section id = "friday">
	
	<h3>Friday</h3>
	
	<h4>Pre-Eskhaton</h4>
	
	<p>Attendees should plan on arriving in Providence by noon on Friday. It is recommended that attendees have lunch (on your own) prior to Eskhaton's <strong>mandatory</strong> opening workshops.</p>
	
	<p>The check-in time at the Hilton Providence is 4:00pm. Early check-in may be available, but is not guaranteed.</p>
</section>

	<h4>Opening Workshops</h4>
	
	<p>Mandatory opening workshops will be held at the Hilton Providence beginning in the mid-afternoon. These workshops will familiarize participants with Eskhaton's storytelling mechanics and the rules of consent-based play. The workshops will also provide opportunities for participants to get to know each other, refine their characters, and develop their own story elements.</p>
	
	<h4>Dinner &amp; First Session</h4>
	
	<p>After the workshops, attendees will have time to get into character (including costuming). The first larp session will begin with an in-character dinner, followed by several hours of larp, into the late evening.</p>


<section id = "saturday">
	
	<h3>Saturday</h3>
	
	<h4>Morning &amp; Early Afternoon</h4>
	
	<p>A complimentary brunch will be provided for all attendees. Attendees are encouraged to work with each other throughout the day to further refine story ideas for the evening&rsquo;s larp session. There will also be plenty of time to enjoy Providence&rsquo;s local attractions if so desired.</p>
	
	<h4>Second Session</h4>
	
	<p>The second session again opens with a dinner, followed by time for costume changes, leading into the final larp session of the weekend. It is here that secrets will be revealed, conspiracies unraveled, alliances forged and broken, and an Apocalypse brought to bear. Should be a fun night.</p>
	
</section>


<section id = "sunday">
	
	<h3>Sunday</h3>
	
	<p>The check-out time at Hilton Providence is 11:00am. Check-out will be followed by a complimentary brunch and a guided &ldquo;debrief&rdquo; workshop, which will help ensure that participants de-escalate from what may be an intense experience, share feedback, and generally bring closure to the weekend.</p>
	
	<p>We estimate that the debriefing workshop will conclude around 2:00pm. Attendees are strongly encouraged to attend if their travel itineraries allow.</p>
