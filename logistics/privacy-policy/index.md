## Privacy Policy

Reverie Studios takes the privacy of its participants and potential participants seriously. We collect the bare minimum necessary personal information from applicants and participants to aide in event management and the character design process (i.e., email address, street address, etc.). No personally identifying information is recorded by Reverie unless explicitly submitted via the application form, email, or other direct and intentional communication with Reverie staff or their representatives. 

As our events may potentially serve EU citizens, we comply with the [EU General Data Protection Regulation][gdpr]. Any persons who have submitted their personal information to Reverie Studios, residing in the EU or otherwise, may contact us at any time to have their information permanently withdrawn from our records (please email [hello@reverie.studio][hello] to make such a request). 

In addition, this website uses site tracking (Google Analytics) to compile traffic statistics. This information is stored in an anonymized format. By using this website, we assume your permission to collect this type of information.
