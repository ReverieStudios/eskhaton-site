	<h3>Reverie Studios</h3>

	<p><a href = "http://reverie.studio">Reverie Studios</a>, which is made up of three co-founders (Tyler, Ken and Garett) was formed with the purpose of creating experiences that examine existential questions. The co-founders have 20 years or more of larp experience and a solid foundational knowledge in a variety of important areas to a larp. Our first larp, ‘Seance Sessions’, explored the subject of the supernatural from the perspective of those at a seance and what the participants believe happens when they encounter the unknown. Our second larp, ‘A CoG in the Machine’ is about what happens during a world ending scenario and how ordinary people who are part of a ‘continuance of governance’ plan make decisions. ‘Eskhaton’ represents our first larp to fall into the blockbuster category, which is with a vast number of participants and with a high production value, focusing on the theme of the cultists that are typically cast as faceless villains. We designed Eskhaton to examine belief in the context of cosmic horror and how individuals approach rationalism and self-interest when they know the world is ending.</p>

		<h4>Danny</h4>
		<p><img src = "/i/staff/danny.jpg" />Hailing from Manchester, NH, I am a 34 year old steel worker, life long gamer and story crafter. I have always had a penchant for amateur mythography where the horror and beauty of the past manifest how we interpret our world. My intense interest in how the world sees itself has also lead me to being a revolutionary working class political organizer for the last 10 years as well. Writing and speaking, gaming and trying to change the world, is exactly the example I try to lay down, as I will soon also be a father.  Danny is writing the material for the ‘<a href = "/story/extant/">Extant</a>’ cult.

		<h4>Jake</h4>
		<p>Jacob Mandell is a writer, a game designer, and a larp runner. Through his company Darksteel Games, Jacob created and ran the long running campaign larps Lost Eidolons and Occam's Razor. Darksteel's latest campaign, a dieselpunk project called <a href = "http://www.hellcatjive.com">Hellcat Jive</a>, is about to begin. Jacob's game-running philosophy is grounded on the precepts of mutual respect, a safe, inclusive, and immersive atmosphere, and the integration of difficult player decisions leading to lasting consequences.</p>
