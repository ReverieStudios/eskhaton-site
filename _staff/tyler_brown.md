Tyler is an artist and participatory experience designer, focused on creating a tactile and visceral experience for players in all forms of immersive environments. He has worked extensively in theater and film arts and brings a breath of experience to transformational media. He has been a larper for over twenty years and has breadth both creating, running and designing games. 

Professionally, Tyler spends most of his time designing props and building sets for stage production and films and has found both of his jobs tend to cross-pollinate skill sets. Creating brand new experiences and opening up larping to those who have never experienced it's joys is something he deeply cares about.
