<p>As a participant in Eskhaton, you will portray a cultist in one of five cults, or someone associated with them in some fashion. You might even portray something not quite human. Each cult worships an Elder God which is their nominal patron, and each Elder God has its own variation on the impending end time. All of the cultists are gathering together at a celebration for this end time. For far too long the cultists hid in the shadows, guarding themselves against intrusive societies and plagued by internecine wars. As a participant at Eskhaton you will play a cultist that is there to celebrate, to worship and to explore what the ‘end time’ actually means for your character. Belief is a powerful commodity and your character’s beliefs might change and shift, mutating over the course of the event many times over depending on what you hear and experience. In the end your character will be altered irrevocably by what has occurred.</p>

<p>This website contains abbreviated background materials on each cult (see below). For more details on the world of Eskhaton, please see our Participant&rsquo;s Guide.</p>
