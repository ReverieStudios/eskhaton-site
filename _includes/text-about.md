Reverie Studios was [founded][1] by Tyler Brown, Ken Pickering, and Garett Kopczynski with the goal of exploring "Nordic"-style immersive roleplaying, in which participants are both actor and audience.

We are currently focused on organizing small scale (10-15 people) immersive events in the Boston area. If you are interested in such an event, please let us know!

For more information on this style of gameplay and Reverie itself, [see our FAQ][2].
