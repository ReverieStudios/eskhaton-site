#### Reverie Studios's new larp ‘A CoG in the Machine’ debuts on May 16th at Living Games Conference

A larp about what happens when disaster strikes and people take over as the government, ‘[A CoG in the Machine][acog]’ is a brand new larp that Reverie Studios will be running at [Living Games Conference][lgc]. Standing for ‘Continuity of Governance’ this larp assumes the participants are those that inherit responsibility and must make difficult decisions about what to do when there is no other authority. This will be a limited edition run, followed by a 2nd run in October at [High Level Games Conference][hlg].
